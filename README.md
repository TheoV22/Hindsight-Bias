This project aims to prove hindsight bias. 

Hindsight bias, or "creeping determinism," is the tendency to see events as more predictable after they have happened. 
This bias leads people to believe they "knew it all along," which can distort memory and reduce learning from outcomes. 
In decision-making, it can prevent accurate assessment of past choices, creating overconfidence and potentially flawed strategies going forward. 
Recognizing hindsight bias helps in making objective, data-driven decisions and improving future judgment.
